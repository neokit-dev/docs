## What is NeoKit?

NeoKit allows you to create a full SvelteKit website with everything you need in a short amount of time, wigh plugins that provide functionality for:

- Authentification (based on Auth.js)
- User & group management
- Forums
- Page management (static Markdown pages, loaded from a database)
- Image optimization (via Cloudflare Images)
- Direct database access (currently only Cloudflare D1)
- S3 bucket access (currently only Cloudflare R2)
- Email sending (via Resend)
- and much more!

## Setup

<CodeGroup>
```bash Setup SvelteKit
npx sv create
```

```bash Install NeoKit
npx nktool setup --hook
```

```bash Install components for your plugins (optional)
npx nktool components --all
```
</CodeGroup>

You are now basically done on the server side. You just have to use the components in `src/routes` and you're ready to style your website however you want!
